# Render: Rollback via dashboard or CLI
render services rollback <service-id>
```

### Database Rollback (if needed)

```bash
# Revert migrations
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back "migration-name"

# Restore from backup
pg_restore -d $DATABASE_URL backup-pre-deploy-YYYYMMDD.sql
```

### Communication
